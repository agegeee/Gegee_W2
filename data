# Data Source Overview

This dataset comes from the study titled "**Characterization of intact polar lipids in soils for assessing their origin**" published by Ding et al. (2020). The data collection was part of the Jena Experiment, a large grassland biodiversity study located in Jena, Germany. The dataset includes measurements of intact polar lipids in soil, roots, fungi, collembola, amoebae, and bacteria, collected from various soil samples and cultured organisms. The samples were taken in June 2016, with the goal of understanding the origins and distribution of lipid classes in soil ecosystems.
